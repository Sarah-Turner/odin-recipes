    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite sandwich recipes, and makes for a delicious dinner. The recipe is also very simple since it is only made from a few ingredients. The sandwiches are hoagie rolls filled with beef, pepperoncinis, and provolone. Since the beef is made in a crockpot or slow cooker, they absorb the flavor of the pepperoncinis which makes the meat very flavorful and tasty.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar of pepperoncinis</li>
        <li>8 hoagie rolls</li>
        <li>16 slices of provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make small cuts in the chuck roast.</li>
        <li>Insert garlic into the cuts.</li>
        <li>Put roast in a slow cooker and pour the entire jar of pepperoncinis into the cooker.</li>
        <li>Cook the meat on low 6 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Put meat, pepperoncinis, and provolone cheese inside the hoagie rolls.</li>
    </ol>
