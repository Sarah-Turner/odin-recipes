    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is another one of my favorite dishes. However, it does require a lot of ingredients and time to make. The hot stew is perfect on cold or rainy days. The stew is very flavorful and tasty. The meat and carrots also come out very soft from being slow cooked. The dish can either be made overnight or in the morning because it takes so long to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds of beef</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
