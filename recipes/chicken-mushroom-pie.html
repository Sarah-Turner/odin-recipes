    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another one of my favorite dishes. These creamy chicken and mushroom pies only have a few ingredients. They also do not take too much time to make since they use cream of mushroom soup as part of the filling. They also do not require too much time to make compared to the other recipes which can take several hours.</p>
